### OSF R Markdown template 

When I preregister a study, my favourite template to use was the OSF preregistration challenge. Now that the challenge has finished, the COS have created an updated template. When you select a template on the OSF, there is the option to include an R script to demonstrate something like a power analysis or planned analysis. I thought it would be a good idea to streamline this process and combine the preregistration template with the power of R. 

I created a .Rmd file with the OSF preregistration template headers and information. Now you can write your preregistration using R Markdown, and provide any code and output directly, making it fully reproducible. You can download the template here on my [Github page](https://github.com/BartlettJE/BartlettJE.github.io/blob/master/RMarkdown-scripts/OSF%20preregistration%20template.Rmd). 

For an example of how it can be used, you can find a recent preregistration I wrote for a grant application on the OSF. The final knitted version of the document is available as a [PDF](https://osf.io/x5pc3/) for easy reading, and the [.Rmd file](https://osf.io/a3gur/) is available for reproducibility.
