title: About
---

Iâ€™m Dr James Bartlett, lecturer in psychology at the University of Glasgow, UK. I completed my PhD at Coventry University in 2020, where I also finished an undergraduate psychology degree in 2015.

I am a teaching-focused lecturer where I lead a course on research methods and statistics. My background from my PhD is in cognitive neuroscience and smoking/addictive behaviour, but I now focus on research methods pedagogy and collaborations where my expertise in statistics is useful.

I spend most of my time developing open educational resources on research methods and statistics. On the resources page, you will find guides to power analysis, JASP, and building experiments using OpenSesame/PsychoPy.

Research is difficult and there are many things that I wish I was told earlier, or worked out for myself sooner. My aim here is to share some useful tips that you may not be aware of, or just provide an account of my experiences. It is also a place I share research and materials I have worked on.

## Acknowledgements
I originally had a blog through WordPress, but I wanted something more flexible to easily include code. This would not have been possible without the template created by Dean Attali who made [Beautiful Jekyll](http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/). I would recommend starting with his template if you plan on migrating to Github pages and know nothing about html.
