I recently wrote a short piece for the [Journal of European Psychology Studentsâ€™ blog](http://blog.efpsa.org/2016/09/09/publishing-a-registered-report-as-a-postgraduate-researcher/) on publishing a Registered Report (RR) as a postgraduate student. 

I interviewed [Dr. Hannah Hobson](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/hannah.hobson.html), now a post-doctoral researcher at King College London, about her experience of publishing a RR during her PhD. There is also an overview of the pros and cons of publishing a RR as a postgraduate researcher, and some words of encouragement from [Professor Chris Chambers](http://psych.cf.ac.uk/contactsandpeople/chambersc1.php), one of the pioneers of the RR publishing format.
