The aim of my PhD thesis is to build a greater understanding of the differences between smokers. A lot of people talk about smokers as if they were all the same but there are larger differences in how many cigarettes people smoke and what motivates them.

I wrote a short piece for the [Journal of European Psychology Studentsâ€™ blog](http://blog.efpsa.org/2016/09/02/do-smokers-consist-of-a-single-group/) to provide a nuanced view of different smokers and the sort of things you need to consider when conducting research in the area.
