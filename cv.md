My detailed CV can be [downloaded on this page]({{ site.baseurl }}/pdfs/cv-james-bartlett.pdf). In a previous role, I also delivered a journey lecture which acts as a kind of CV of failure.

You can access the [PDF slides on this page]({{ site.baseurl }}/pdfs/journey_lecture.pdf) if you are interested.
